# Data Structure Learning Code Repo
Private storage for code written during my data structure learning, serving as a personal archive and review reference.
The project is only build by C code.

## Project Structure
| Directory  | Description                                                                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/`     | Stores executable source code files (e.g., `.c`, `.cpp`).                                          |
| `include/` | Stores header files (e.g., `.h`, `.hpp`) for function declarations and data structure definitions. |


## How to Use
1. Clone the repo to your local machine (if using Git).
2. Compile source files with headers (e.g., `gcc src/xxx.c -o xxx -I include/` for C/C++).
3. Run the executable and review/extend code as needed.


## Note
For personal learning only; code prioritizes readability over production optimization.
